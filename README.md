INTRODUCTION
This website was created to help in organizing incident reports completed by organizations regarding their employees. This website allows employers to document the individual's name, employee number, email, incident number, location that the incident took place, and the description of the incident that took place. This website allows individuals to create, read, delete and edit incident reports that they created. 

UI
This is just a very basic template created to get the site up and running. The final design in later versions will be very different from what is shown here. This interface will allow users to create, launch and manage (delete, edit, restart, etc.) their incident reports. This interface not only outlines the content that is being created but provides users the ability to contact the creators of the site regarding any issues or concerns they may have.
